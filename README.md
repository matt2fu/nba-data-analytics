# NBA Data Analytics

This project focuses on the National Basketball Association (NBA). We wanted to find what factors led to a home team not only winning a game, but dominating the away team. "Dominance" was measured using the home team's plus minus score, i.e. the point difference of the home team minus the away team. Then, using ML techniques, we analyzed how different play styles correlated to different magnitudes of dominance.

For this project, we use two datasets: one on previous NBA games (60,000+) and one on the stats of each player in each previous NBA game. The NBA games dataset allow us to analyze the different aspects of the game a home team is doing well, and the consequential success the team is seeing. The dataset of the stats of each player in each previous NBA game allow us to ask more interesting questions on how the home team dynamic is. We can inspect if one player is scoring the most points or if the points are more distributed.
